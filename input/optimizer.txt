/**
* This program tests the optimization visitor by constant folding and constant propagation

// Tests constant folding

int i = 5;
i = 10 + -15 * 20 / 5 + 30 * -(-1000 + 999.5);

// Tests constant propagation

int five = 5; // Declare and initialize five
int b = 5 + five; // Should be constant propagated and folded to 10
int c = + (b + five)*15 - 20; // Should get propagated and folded to a literal
c = 4;
// Reassign c to something else, there is no reaching definition of c anymore so no propagation is done
// From now on anymore
int not_propagated = c + 2; // This will not be propagated due to the reaching definition principle
